    // Promise is a object, to inkove it we set a constructor and pass a callback function with two arguments
    // those two arguments are also function

    // Promise has three states Pending, Rejected, Fullfilled
    // once the Promise is either rejected or fullfilled you can't go back to other state (it's a one-way street)

    // promise is pending by default

    // to access the value in resolve .then is used
    // to access the value in reject .catch is used

    const value = 2;

    const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 3);
      console.log(random);

      if (random === value) {
        resolve("Correct Number")
      } else {
        reject("Wrong Number")
      }
    });
    console.log(promise);

    promise.then((data) => console.log(data)).catch((err) => console.log(err))

    // here, we set an example where if the condition is fullfilled the promise is resolved or else rejected

    // promises are widely used for http request only
    // to get the data if the condition is fullfilled or else reject it
